## Ruck
Ruck is a discord bot that is intended to be stupidly funny. I really hope that you enjoy this bot. You can use Ruck in your server by finding it on top.gg or using the code here.

## How to get started
First things first you have to have dotenv, and if you do not have this you can download it using the instructions here >> https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/ then create a `.env ` file. The file should look like this. `TOKEN=your_discord_token_here`, you can get your discord token from the discord developer portal >> https://discord.com/developers then start up the bot! Dont forget to add the bot to your server!
